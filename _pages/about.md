I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, Bloomington. I obtained a master's degree (MS) in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). My research interests include machine learning systems, data compression, high-performance computing and cloud computing.

News
